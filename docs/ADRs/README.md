# ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant technical decisions and their tradeoffs.

Guidelines:
- Write an ADR for decisions that are expensive to reverse (security model, data retention, gate semantics, telemetry tiers).
- Keep ADRs short and concrete: context, decision, consequences, and alternatives.

Template:
- Start from `docs/templates/ADR_TEMPLATE.md`.

Naming:
- `docs/ADRs/0001-short-title.md`
- `docs/ADRs/0002-short-title.md`
